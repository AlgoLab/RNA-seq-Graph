CHAIN BUILDING PROCEDURE
To build chains from the hash table we adopt the following procedure:
1) We scan the table and for each UNSPLICED entry we look for the entry (in the same table)
   that has as key the right_fingerprint of the first entry.
   This means that the two entry are overlapped for an half.
   At this point we start from this new entry and we look for the one that has, as left_fingerprint
   the right_fingerprint of this entry. W eiterate this process until we reach the end of the table.
